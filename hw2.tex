\section{Linear Classification}

\subsection{Classification Results}

$\mathbf{v}_h$ is a unit vector.

\begin{lstlisting}
vh = matrix(c(1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), nrow=2)
c = 1/(2 * sqrt(2))
x1 = matrix(c(-3, 0), nrow=2)
x2 = matrix(c(1/2, 1/2), nrow=2)

> sign(crossprod(x1, vh) - c)
     [,1]
[1,]   -1
> sign(crossprod(x2, vh) - c)
     [,1]
[1,]    1
\end{lstlisting}

\[r_1 = \sgn(<\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{v}_h> - c) = -1 \]
\[r_1 = \sgn(<\mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{v}_h> - c) = 1 \]

\subsection{SVM with Margin}

The values of the cross products with offset $c$ are as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
> crossprod(x1, vh) - c
          [,1]
[1,] -2.474874
> crossprod(x2, vh) - c
          [,1]
[1,] 0.3535534
\end{lstlisting}

$\mathbf{x}_1$ is still on the negative side and classified the same. However, $\mathbf{x}_2$ is not greater than the margin of 1, hence will not be classified as positive. If $\mathbf{x}_2$ was in the training set, $\mathbf{v}_h$ and $c$ would not have been selected as the classifier as the classifier for a SVM with margin would have ensured that $<\mathbf{v}_h, \mathbf{x}> - c > 1$ or $< -1$ for all training data.

\subsection{Cost Function Approximated by Perceptron Cost Function}

It approximates the empirical risk function. Empirical risk function is piece-wise constant, hence would not allow us to gradient descent optimally. The perceptron cost function, by using $\left|\left<\mathbf{z} ,\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i \end{pmatrix}\right>\right|$ instead of just the loss function.

Slope can be obtained from $\mathbf{v}_h$ by

\[v_x x + v_y y - c = 0\]

and solving accordingly.
